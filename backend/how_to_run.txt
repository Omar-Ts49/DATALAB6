To run the followings CLI to query info from the database: 
PLEASE NOTE: In order to make the queries work we had to create our own environment in which many libs were installed (following the instructions given in the lab) 
therefore, to use our CLI on your machine all of the libs must be installed
=> Run the following command prompts in your command line : 
    -> Command list patients: 
        python cli.py list_patients
    -> Command schedule appt :
        python cli.py schedule_appt --caid "input_value" --iid "input_value" --staff "input_value" --dep "input_value" --date""input_value: YYYY-MM-DD" --time "input_value: HH:MM:SS" --reason "input_value" 
    -> Command low stock : 
        python cli.py low_stock
    -> Command staff share : 
        python cli.py staff_share
